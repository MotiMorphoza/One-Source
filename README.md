# ONE SOURCE

ONE SOURCE is a static browser app that unifies three language-learning modes behind one shell:

- Flash Cards
- Word Match
- Word Puzzle

The repo is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to stay GitHub Pages friendly and not depend on a product backend.

## Current Repo Reality

- Entry point: `index.html`
- Main app controller: `core/hubManager.js`
- Bundled content registry: `hubIndex.js`
- Generated app-shell cache manifest: `sw-assets.js`
- Shared data loader: `core/hubAdapter.js`
- Shared storage: `core/storage.js`
- Shared session logic: `core/engine.js`
- Games: `games/flashcards.js`, `games/wordmatch.js`, `games/wordpuzzle.js`
- App icons: `assets/icons/`
- Bundled hub content lives in `hub/`
- Local user content lives in browser `localStorage`

Important: this repo does **not** currently ship a live `index.json`. The app reads `window.HUB_INDEX` from `hubIndex.js`.

## How The App Works Today

1. The home screen lets the user choose a language pair and a game.
2. The home accordion renders as two roots:
   - `Choose a topic` for bundled HUB content
   - `My lists` for editable local content
3. Starting a bundled HUB file fetches its CSV and also stores a local cached copy so it becomes available in the Library.
4. A HUB list that was only started is still treated as HUB content in the Library.
5. The first real edit to that cached HUB list promotes it into a local editable list (`MINE`).
6. Hard items are tracked across play sessions.
7. `My lists` can now auto-generate `Hard words` and `Hard sentences` when an item was answered wrong at least twice.
8. Games run through a shared `SessionEngine`.

## Bundled Hub Layout

Bundled hub content lives in this physical structure:

```text
hub/<language-pair>/<topic>/<file>.csv
```

Example:

```text
hub/he-en/sentences/to_leave_or_not.csv
hub/he-en/daily/daily000.csv
hub/he-en/misc/more-less-too-very-most.csv
```

`hubIndex.js` is generated from that folder structure by `scripts/build_hub_index.py`.

## Library Behavior

- The Library is a management surface for both bundled and local lists.
- Every card in the Library now uses `Edit`.
- Library cards can be removed directly from the Library screen.
- Removing a HUB list from the Library does **not** remove it from Home or from `hub/`.
- Local lists can be deleted from the Library.
- The editor screen no longer owns list deletion.

## Source Status Model

Current source states in code:

- `hub`: bundled file from `hub/`
- `hub-cache`: a bundled file that was started or opened and cached locally for Library access
- `hub-copy`: a former HUB file that was actually edited and is now part of local editable content
- `local`: user-created list
- `import`: CSV-imported list

UI meaning:

- `HUB` badge: `hub` and `hub-cache`
- `MINE` badge: `hub-copy`, `local`, and `import`

## Hard Lists

- A row becomes part of the hard lists after 2 wrong answers.
- Hard rows are aggregated across all lists for the same language pair.
- Non-sentence content becomes `Hard words`.
- Sentence content becomes `Hard sentences`.
- These lists are generated automatically under `My lists`.

## Content Rules In Code

- Topic `sentences` is available to Flash Cards, Word Match, and Word Puzzle.
- All other topics are available to Flash Cards and Word Match.
- Word Puzzle can use only the `sentences` topic.
- Rows are normalized to `{ id, source, target }`.
- Users can create their own topics from the Library UI.
- Duplicate list names are blocked within the same language pair and topic.

## Local Development

Open the project through HTTP, not `file://`.

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`.

To rebuild the bundled hub index locally:

```bash
python scripts/build_hub_index.py
```

To rebuild the generated service-worker asset manifest locally:

```bash
python scripts/build_sw_assets.py
```

## GitHub Automation

The repo includes:

- `.github/workflows/rebuild-hub-index.yml`
- `.github/workflows/rebuild-sw-assets.yml`

When you push changes under `hub/`, GitHub Actions:

1. scans the physical hub folders
2. rebuilds `hubIndex.js`
3. commits the updated index back to `main`

Normal content flow:

1. add a new topic folder under `hub/<language-pair>/`
2. add one or more `.csv` files
3. push to GitHub

After the workflow finishes, the new bundled content is reflected on the site.

## Current Gaps Still Confirmed

- `hubIndex.js` is still the live metadata source
- there is still no live `index.json`
- cache name bumps are still required when the shipped shell changes
- recent Library/HUB flows still need live browser and PWA regression coverage

## PWA Assets

- The app now ships a favicon SVG, a 32px PNG fallback, an Apple touch icon, and 192px/512px manifest icons under `assets/icons/`.
- `manifest.json` includes the current install icons.
- `sw.js` now precaches the app shell from generated `sw-assets.js`, which is built from `index.html` and the current static import graph.

## Scope Note

`server.js` is only a local static file server for development. It is not a product backend.
